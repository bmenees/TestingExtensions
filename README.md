## History
This is a "fork" of the [Visual Studio Testing Extensions](https://archive.codeplex.com/?p=vstestingextensions)
(vstestingextensions) project that was originally created on CodePlex by [Jeremiah Clark](https://twitter.com/JeremiahClark). He released versions 1.0-[1.2](https://www.nuget.org/packages/VisualStudioTestingExtensions) between 2009 and 2012, and his releases targeted .NET Framework 4.0 using MSTest V1. The project was also known as SoftwareApproach.TestingExtensions because that's the assembly name and namespace it used.

This "fork" has minimal changes, and it has only been updated to:
* Target .NET Standard 2.0
* Use MSTest V2
* Use assembly version 2.0

It's useful if you're migrating an old codebase from .NET Framework to .NET Core and [upgrading its unit tests to MSTest V2](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/devops/upgrade-to-mstest-v2/).
